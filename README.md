# Expression markers of block hypomethylation 

### Gene sets defined using TCGA COAD

1. Genes upregulated with hypomethylation: `coad_hypometh_up_genes.txt`
  
2. Genes downregulated with hypomethylation: `input/2020_johnstone_reyes_table_s5.txt`

    This gene set is taken from Johnstone & Reyes 2020 and contains genes that are downregulated with hypomethylation, and includes additional filtering for non-immune infiltrate genes.
  
3. Gene expression ratio of the A vs B compartments

    This can be calculated as the expression ratio of `coad_a_genes.txt` and `coad_b_genes.txt`
